# [FULL STACK OPEN 2020](https://fullstackopen.com/en) - EXERCISES SOLUTIONS

## Considerations

Throughout the development of the projects/exercises proposed in the course, the following considerations are intended to be followed as close as possible:

- Commit messages formatting following the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) guidelines. Please note that no release notes generation is expected from this project's commit messages.
- This repository is organized using a part-by-part structure just like the course contents.  

## [Part 0](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part0)

The first part starts providing information related to the way the course is structured, the exercises submmitting system, and related info regarding the course logistics.
