# [FULL STACK OPEN 2020](https://fullstackopen.com/en) - EXERCISES SOLUTIONS

## Considerations

Throughout the development of the projects/exercises proposed in the course, the following considerations are intended to be followed as close as possible:

- Commit messages formatting following the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification) guidelines.
- This repository is organized using a part-by-part structure just like the course contents.
